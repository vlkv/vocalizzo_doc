## New Exercises and How to Find Them

Recently, I have added several new exercises to the Full version, they are:
* Two notes 'Ma'
* Major Triad 'Ma' #1
* Major Triad 'Ma' #2
* Five Note 'Me-yo'
* Fifth 'Mee may mah moh mooh'
* Fifth 'A-mo-re'
* Fine Vocals 'Ma-a-ah' #1
* Fine Vocals 'Ma-a-ah' #2
* Pattern 'Me-yo'

The Lite version got only three of them:
* Two notes 'Ma'
* Fine Vocals 'Ma-a-ah' #2
* Pattern 'Me-yo'

If you have ever edited your groups of exercises, then you may not see the new exercises right away. In such a case you have two options:
* Option 1. Go to Vocalizzo Settings screen and reset all the settings. But beware, that you will lose ALL YOUR CUSTOM EXERCISES GROUPS then (sure, you will be able to recreate them, but this will take time and effort). If you care about them, then go for the next option.
* Option 2.
  * On Main sreen tap the '+' and add new Group of exercises.
  * Go to the new group and tap a 'pencil' icon to start editing it.
  * A dialog with list of all available exercises will be popped up.
  * New exercises will be marked with a tiny red tag that says "NEW". Select their checkboxes adding them to the group. Done, go back and check them out!

I hope you will enjoy the Vocalizzo 2.1-49 release!
