## Pitch Monitor

Recently, I've added a 'Pitch Monitor' tool to the Vocalizzo app. This tool simply shows at real time all the notes
that you're singing and... that's it, it does nothing more. And it is a great tool for any vocalist and I will shortly 
explain what can you do with it.

## How to start it
To start the 'Pitch Monitor' go to the '3 vertical dots' menu (top right corner) on the main Vocalizzo screen and
tap on the 'Pitch Monitor' menu item:

![](pitch_monitor/three_dots_menu.jpg){:height="324px"}.
![](pitch_monitor/pitch_monitor_menu_item.jpg){:height="324px"}.
![](pitch_monitor/pitch_monitor_started.jpg){:height="324px"}.

Tap the microphone button and sing something. You will see the visualization of your singing right away, something like this:

![](pitch_monitor/pitch_monitor_some_singing.jpg){:height="324px"}.

## The 'Vocal Slide' exercise
Make an 'e-e-e' or 'o-o-oh' (or any comfortable to you) sound and gradually slide through the notes of 
about a two-octave range. Slide up and then back down. Here is what I've done:

## The 'Siren' exercise
Imitate a siren of an emergency vehicle. Something like this:

![](pitch_monitor/siren.jpg){:height="324px"}.

## Conclusion
There are tons of variations of Siren/Slide exercises which you may easily find in the Internet. I hope that
Vocalizzo's Pitch Monitor will help you with your vocal training and make it more fun!
