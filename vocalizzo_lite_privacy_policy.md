## Privacy Policy

Vitaly Volkov built the Vocalizzo Lite app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Vitaly Volkov at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to audio recorded from device's microphone. The information that I request may be retained on your device for some time and is not collected by me in any way.

Specifically, the recorded audio is used only to detect and visualize the voice pitch of the notes that you sing while using the app. Audio recording switches ON only in two cases:

* On the app screen 'Vocal Range' when the 'MIC' toggle button is ON. The recorded audio is used to detect the
  pitch of the notes that you sing. These notes are displayed on the screen and used to adjust your 'vocal range' setting.

* On the app exercise training screen when you start the melody playback (either by pressing
  the 'Play' button or pressing one of the musical keyboard keys). Audio recording automatically stops when the melody
  playback stops. The recorded audio is used to detect the pitch of the notes that you sing which are used
  to visualize them over the played exercise melody notes.

The recorded audio is not stored persistently on the device, not shared with any third parties, not transferred over the Internet by the app, not used in any other way except as described in this document.

You may not grant the app permission to record audio. In such a case, no audio will be recorded and the app could be used with the pitch detection features disabled.

The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

**Log Data**

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

**Cookies**

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

**Security**

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Links to Other Sites**

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
